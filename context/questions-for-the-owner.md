# Questions for the owner

Questions the agent could not answer alone, written down so the work could go on (the owner's
instruction of 2026-10-16: "If you do have questions, please write them down in the repo and
continue working"). Each says what waits on it and what the agent did meanwhile. An answered
question moves to the bottom with the answer and the date.

## Open

(None.)

## Answered

### 1. Constitution: "only the grants the embedder gives, which may be none"

- **Asked:** 2026-10-16. **Source:** `research/2026-10-16-a-principal-engineers-direction.md`
  (direction 4, "Constitution changes proposed"), `research/2026-10-16-where-package-data-lives.md`
  ("The owner's direction").
- **The change:** §2.2 and §2.4 say the guest sees "the one directory the embedder preopens".
  They would say: only the grants the embedder gives (read-only or writable folders), which may
  be none. The embedder contract becomes "bind one function, call one export; preopen what you
  grant".
- **What waits:** matplotlib's data (a second, read-only folder), several folders per run
  (typed grants), and a run with no folder at all.
- **Meanwhile:** the agent builds what the current text allows (spec 005, the hostile-guest
  checks, safe defaults with one folder).
- **Answered 2026-10-17:** Yes: typed grants, read-only or writable, which may be none. The constitution's §2.2 and §2.4 are amended.

### 2. matplotlib's data: a read-only folder (C2) or packed inside the binary (C3, wasi-vfs)

- **Asked:** 2026-10-16. **Source:** `research/2026-10-16-where-package-data-lives.md`,
  `research/2026-10-16-wasi-vfs-for-package-data.md`.
- **The agent's recommendation:** C2, a read-only folder mounted at the path matplotlib already
  looks in. wasi-vfs works on the real build and allows zero folders, but its packed output is
  not byte-reproducible (uninitialised padding), it adds about one instruction of start-up per
  packed byte for a reason not found, it brings Rust runtime code whose licences would ship, and
  it has one maintainer who has said he has little time. C3 is worth it only if a run with no
  folder at all, and the stdlib zip inside the binary, become goals.
- **What waits:** the matplotlib specification.
- **Answered 2026-10-17:** C2: a read-only folder where matplotlib already looks, built on typed grants. The constitution's §2 records it.

### 3. A new hard constraint, "safe by default"

- **Asked:** 2026-10-16. **Source:** the principal engineer's memo.
- **The change:** a new §4 rule: every limit has a default; no channel to the host opens
  without an explicit argument; the runtime's files are never in a writable grant.
- **Meanwhile:** the agent gives `run()` safe defaults anyway (your direction: "no way (unless
  explicitly provided) to access the host file system or network"); the rule would make them
  binding on every later change.
- **Answered 2026-10-17:** Yes, binding: §4.15 "Safe by default". A change that loosens a default needs the owner's decision.

### 4. Order of post-v1 work: sqlite3, bz2, lzma before matplotlib?

- **Asked:** 2026-10-16. **Source:** the principal engineer's memo, direction 8.
- **The question:** your order is matplotlib, then sqlite3/bz2/lzma, then scipy. matplotlib now
  waits on questions 1 and 2; sqlite3, bz2 and lzma need no C++ and no data folder. The agent
  works on them while matplotlib waits, and keeps your order for anything not blocked.
- **Answered 2026-10-17:** sqlite3, bz2 and lzma first (spec 007), then typed grants and matplotlib. The constitution's §2 records it.

### 5. Security rules for releases

- **Asked:** 2026-10-16. **Source:** the principal engineer's memo, direction 7.
- **The change:** §5.5 gains "a security fix in a pinned component is a reason to release";
  §5.6 gains "a security review against the written threat model before each release".
- **Meanwhile:** the agent adds `SECURITY.md` and build-provenance attestations to the release
  workflow, which change no rule.
- **Answered 2026-10-17:** Both: §5.5 (a security fix in a pinned component is a reason to release; the agent prepares one and asks) and §5.6 (a security review against the threat model before each release).

### 6. May the agent publish 0.1.0a2?

- **Asked:** 2026-10-16.
- **The question:** you authorised 0.1.0a1. Spec 005 names the 3.15 line's release `0.1.0a2`.
  The agent will prepare it (version bump, changelog, a green dry run of the release workflow)
  but will not push the tag until you say so (constitution §7).
- **Status, 2026-10-17:** ready. `__version__` is `0.1.0a2`, and the CHANGELOG's unreleased
  section covers specs 005 to 014. The dry run of `1f21dd0` passed every job, including the arm64
  Linux rebuild with byte-identical `SHA256SUMS`. Before tagging, the agent will run one security
  review of the release against the threat model, by a fresh agent. Releasing is one command
  (`release/version.py release`) once you say yes.
- **Answered 2026-10-17:** Yes, after a security review of the release against the threat model by a fresh agent; then the agent tags v0.1.0a2.

### 7. A `wasi-python run` command line?

- **Asked:** 2026-10-16. **Source:** the principal engineer's memo.
- **The question:** §3 says the project "ships no shell". Is a thin command that runs a program
  and prints a JSON result part of the runner (allowed) or a shell (not)? The agent reads it as
  the runner but does not build it until you answer.
- **Answered 2026-10-17:** Yes, as part of the runner: `wasi-python run` prints one program's result as JSON. The constitution's §3 records it.

### 8. numpy's `.npy` files

- **Asked:** 2026-10-16. **Source:** `research/2026-10-16-what-data-folders-the-packages-need.md`.
- **The fact:** `np.save` and `np.load` of `.npy` files fail in 0.1.0a1 because numpy calls
  `os.dup`, which WASI preview1 does not have. Zero patches rules out a local fix.
- **The question:** may the agent file an upstream numpy issue (an outward-facing action)? The
  agent writes the issue text into the repository and records the failure as a known gap.
- **Answered 2026-10-17:** File it, after the owner reads and approves the text (drafted as an artifact).

### 9. Licences for sqlite3, bz2 and lzma

- **Asked:** 2026-10-17. **Source:** `research/2026-10-17-sqlite-bz2-and-lzma.md`.
- **The question:** constitution §4.12: "Nothing with a licence the owner has not approved is
  linked in." Building these three modules in links: SQLite 3.54.1 (public domain: its
  header's blessing, no licence file), bzip2 1.0.8 (its own BSD-style licence), and liblzma from
  xz 5.8.4 (0BSD). Do you approve them?
- **What waits:** spec 007 (sqlite3, bz2 and lzma) is written and reviewed, but not built, until
  you answer. The experiment shows all three build with no patch; bz2 and lzma match native
  byte for byte; sqlite3 works with one limit (one connection writes at a time, through a lock
  directory beside the database).
- **Answered 2026-10-17:** Approved: SQLite (public domain), bzip2 (BSD-style), liblzma from xz (0BSD). The constitution's §4.12 records it; spec 007 is unblocked.

### 10. Turn on private vulnerability reporting?

- **Asked:** 2026-10-17. **Source:** spec 009 (`specifications/009-release-security.md`).
- **The question:** `SECURITY.md` asks reporters to use GitHub's "Report a vulnerability"
  button, which works only when private vulnerability reporting is on in the repository's
  settings (Settings → Code security). May the agent turn it on (`gh api -X PUT
  repos/ClayGendron/wasi_python/private-vulnerability-reporting`), or will you?
- **Meanwhile:** `SECURITY.md` is not written yet; it waits on this answer (spec 010, the other
  thing it waited on, landed 2026-10-17), so that its reporting route works.
- **Answered 2026-10-17:** Yes, the agent turns it on (`gh api`), then writes `SECURITY.md`.

### 11. File a wasmtime-py issue about its shared callback tables?

- **Asked:** 2026-10-17. **Source:** spec 010's build review, finding 1, and spec 011
  (`specifications/011-concurrent-calls-share-nothing.md`).
- **The fact:** wasmtime-py keeps the Python callbacks of `define_func` and of custom WASI
  output in two process-wide tables with no lock. Threads that define or free them at once
  corrupt the tables (EXECUTED: after a few hundred concurrent calls every later call raised).
  Spec 011 works around it in the runner, without patching wasmtime-py.
- **The question:** may the agent file the issue (an outward-facing action)? The agent writes
  its text into spec 011's landing notes either way.
- **Answered 2026-10-17:** File it, after the owner reads and approves the text (drafted as an artifact).
